## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the ETL pipeline on your local machine.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dungpham0703/gold_etl_pipeline.git
cd gold_etl_pipeline
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Google App Password (for Gmail)

Since Gmail no longer allows direct SMTP login with your normal password,  
you must create a **Google App Password** to let Airflow send emails securely.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification**  
   üëâ [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)

2. Turn on **2-Step Verification**.

3. Then open **App Passwords**  
   üëâ [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

4. Choose:
   - **App:** Other (Custom name) ‚Üí type `Gold_ETL_Pipeline`
   - **Device:** Your computer

5. Click **Generate**, copy the 16-character password Google gives you.

6. Paste it into your `.env` file like this:
   ```env
   GMAIL_USER=youremail@gmail.com
   GMAIL_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
   
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
GOLD_API_URL=https://www.goldapi.io/api/XAU/USD
GOLD_API_KEY= get_your_api_key_at_https://www.goldapi.io/dashboard
AIRFLOW_UID=50000
GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start Airflow with Docker
Running the Docker then:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
After setup completes, open Airflow in your browser at localhost:8080
Default credentials:
```bash
Username: airflow
Password: airflow
```
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the DAG

Open Airflow, find the DAG named gold_data_dag, and trigger it manually and you will know how high gold price is through email.

Each task performs the following:

Extract data from API -> Transform with pandas -> Send CSV file to your email.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Stop All Containers

Stop the Airflow environment cleanly:
```bash
docker compose down
```


load_task ‚Üí Sends the cleaned CSV to your Gmail inbox
