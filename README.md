## ‚ú® Key Features

* üïí **Automated Scheduling** ‚Äî The pipeline runs daily through Apache Airflow.
* üåê **API Integration** ‚Äî Fetches live gold price data from [GoldAPI.io](https://www.goldapi.io/).
* üßÆ **Data Transformation** ‚Äî Cleans and formats JSON data into a structured CSV using pandas.
* üìß **Email Automation** ‚Äî Sends the processed CSV to your Gmail inbox via SMTP.
* üê≥ **Containerized Setup** ‚Äî Runs entirely in Docker Compose for easy deployment and portability.

## üóÇ Project Structure

The project is organized for clarity and modularity:

```bash
automated_gold_pipeline/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/               # Airflow configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dags/                 # gold DAG
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                  # ETL scripts (extract, transform, load)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml   # Docker setup for Airflow services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Just example, not real environment variables
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Documentation
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the ETL pipeline on your local machine.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dungpham0703/gold_etl_pipeline.git
cd gold_etl_pipeline
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Google App Password (for Gmail)

Since Gmail no longer allows direct SMTP login with your normal password,  
you must create a **Google App Password** to let Airflow send emails securely.

and then:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
After setup completes, open Airflow in your browser at localhost:8080
Default credentials:
```bash
Username: airflow
Password: airflow
```
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the DAG

Open Airflow, find the DAG named gold_data_dag, and trigger it manually and you will know how high gold price is through email.

Each task performs the following:

Extract data from API -> Transform with pandas -> Send CSV file to your email.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Stop All Containers

Stop the Airflow environment cleanly:
```bash
docker compose down
```
